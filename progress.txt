## Codebase Patterns
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for all CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements in migrations
- sql-migrate uses `-- +migrate Up` and `-- +migrate Down` comment markers
- Source .env before running sql-migrate: `set -a && source .env && set +a && sql-migrate up`
- dbconfig.yml uses `host=${DB_HOST} dbname=${DB_NAME} user=${DB_ADMIN_USERNAME} password=${DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD} sslmode=disable` format
- DB admin credentials are in .env as DB_ADMIN_USERNAME/DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD; app credentials as DB_USERNAME/DB_PASSWORD
- sqlc config at sqlc.yaml uses pgx/v5 driver with custom type overrides for timestamptz and nullable text
- Build with `go build ./...` to verify no compilation errors
- Makefile `db/models.go` target runs `go tool sqlc generate` when query or schema files change

## 2026-02-04 15:48 MST - US-001
- Created events table migration: schema/20260204154757-create-events-table.sql
- Table has 8 columns: id (UUID PK), subject, timestamp, trace_id, data (JSONB), retry_count, delivery_status, status_updated_at
- Three indexes: subject, timestamp, delivery_status
- Migration applies cleanly via sql-migrate up
- Files changed: schema/20260204154757-create-events-table.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The database was already provisioned via Docker with slurpee_admin and slurpee roles
  - gorp_migrations table tracks applied migrations (used by sql-migrate)
  - Previous session work wasn't on a persisted branch, so had to recreate from scratch
  - Always verify migration status with `sql-migrate status` after applying
