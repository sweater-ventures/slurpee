## Codebase Patterns
- Use `::bigint` cast on `COUNT(*)` in sqlc queries so generated Go type is `int64` (not `interface{}`)
- `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ...)` is valid PostgreSQL syntax for conditional aggregation
- Two mock querier implementations exist: `testutil/mock_querier.go` and `app/delivery_test.go` (import cycle prevention). Both must be updated when adding new queries.
- sqlc generates prepared query constants, param structs, and row structs — run `sqlc generate` then `go build` to verify

## 2026-02-09 12:00pm - US-001
- Added `GetResumableEvents` query to `queries/events.sql`: selects events with delivery_status IN ('pending', 'partial') ordered by timestamp ASC
- Added `GetDeliverySummaryForEvent` query to `queries/delivery_attempts.sql`: groups delivery attempts by subscriber_id with COUNT FILTER for failed/succeeded counts
- Ran `sqlc generate` — produced `GetDeliverySummaryForEventRow` struct with `SubscriberID pgtype.UUID`, `FailedCount int64`, `SucceededCount int64`
- Updated both mock querier implementations (testutil + app/delivery_test.go) with new interface methods
- Files changed: queries/events.sql, queries/delivery_attempts.sql, db/events.sql.go, db/delivery_attempts.sql.go, db/querier.go, testutil/mock_querier.go, app/delivery_test.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Two mock querier files must stay in sync with db.Querier interface
  - The `::bigint` cast trick works well — sqlc maps it to Go `int64`
  - `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'x')` avoids subqueries for per-group conditional counts
