## Codebase Patterns
- templ files use tabs for indentation
- API auth uses X-Slurpee-Secret header for event endpoints, X-Slurpee-Admin-Secret for subscriber endpoints
- db.Querier already has DeleteSubscriber and DeleteSubscriptionsForSubscriber methods
- Subscriber API handlers are in api/subscribers.go
- Follow existing patterns in api/ for new endpoints
