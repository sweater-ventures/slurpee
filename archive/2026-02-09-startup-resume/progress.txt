## Codebase Patterns
- Use `::bigint` cast on `COUNT(*)` in sqlc queries so generated Go type is `int64` (not `interface{}`)
- Two mock querier implementations exist: `testutil/mock_querier.go` and `app/delivery_test.go` (import cycle prevention). Both must be updated when adding new queries.
- sqlc generates prepared query constants, param structs, and row structs — run `sqlc generate` then `go build` to verify
- templ files use tabs for indentation — Edit tool shows them as spaces but must match tabs exactly
- BusMessage is published in two places: `api/events.go` (API creation) and `views/events.go` (UI creation)
- Existing `LogEvent()` in `api/events.go` shows the pattern for extracting log_config properties from event data
- DaisyUI badge components: `badge badge-ghost`, `badge badge-outline`, `badge badge-sm`
- EventBus SSE live mode: `eventsStreamHandler` in `views/events.go`, JS in `views/events.templ`
- Missed events recovery: `eventsMissedHandler` in `views/events.go`
